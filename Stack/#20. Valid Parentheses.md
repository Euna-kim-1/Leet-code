# Problem Statement

Given a string s containing just the characters `'('`, `')'`, `'{'`, `'}'`, `'['` and `']'`, determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is valid if:

1. Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
2. Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
3. Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.

## Example 1
Input: `s = "()"`
Output: `true`

## Example 2
Input: `s = "()[]{}"`
Output: `true`

## Example 3
Input: `s = "(]"`
Output: `false`

## Solution

```python
class Solution(object):
    def isValid(self, s):
        # Initialize an empty stack to keep track of opening brackets
        stack = []
        
        # Dictionary to map closing brackets to their corresponding opening brackets 
        mapping = {")":"(", "}":"{", "]":"["}
    
        # Iterate over each character in the string
        for char in s:
            # Check if the current character is one of the closing brackets
            if char in mapping:
                # If the stack is empty, there is no matching opening bracket
                if not stack:
                    return False
                # Pop the top element from the stack
                top_element = stack.pop()
                # If the popped element does not match the mapping, brackets are not balanced
                if mapping[char] != top_element:
                    return False
               
            # If the current character is an opening bracket
            else:
                # Push it onto the stack
                stack.append(char)
        # After processing all characters, check if the stack is empty
        # If the stack is not empty, there are unmatched opening brackets left
        return not stack

        # Why we have to use "return not stack" instead of "return true" :
        # The expression 'not stack' checks if the stack is empty. If the stack is empty after processing all characters in the string,
        # it means that all opening brackets had corresponding closing brackets and were removed from the stack correctly, indicating a balanced sequence.
        # By changing this line to 'return True', the function will always return 'True', regardless of whether stack is empty or not.
        # This means it will indicate that the sequence is valid(balanced) even when there are unmatched opening brackets left in the stack, 
        # which clearly should result in 'False' for an unbalanced sequence.


        class Solution:
            def isValid(self, s: str) -> bool:
                # Initialize an empty stack 
                stack = []

                # Check if the first character is a closing bracket
                if "}" in s[0] or "]" in s[0] or ")" in s[0]:
                    return False
        
                # Check if the length of the sgring is odd
                if len(s) % 2 != 0:
                    return False

                # Iterate over each character in the string
                for char in s:
                    # If the character is an opening bracket, push it onto the stack
                    if (char == "(") or (char == "{") or (char == "["):
                        stack.append(char)
    
                    # If the character is a closing bracket
                    if char == "]":
                        # Check if the stack is empty or the top of the stack is not the matching opening bracket
                        if not stack or stack.pop() != "[":
                            return False

                    elif char == "}":
                        # Check if the stack is empty or the top of the stack is not the matching opening bracket
                        if not stack or stack.pop() != "{":
                            return False

                    elif char == ")": 
                        # Check if the stack is empty or the top of the stack is not the matching opening bracket
                        if not stack or stack.pop() != "(":
                            return False

                # If the stack is empty, all opening brackets were matched correctly
                return len(stack) == 0
```

## Complexity Analysis
- Time Complexity: O(n), as it processes each character in the string once.
- Space Complexity: O(n), where the stack may store every character in the string.
