# Problem Statement

You are given an array of strings `tokens` that represents an arithmetic expression in a <b>Reverse Polish Notation.</b>

Evaluate the expression. Return an integer that represents the value of the expression.

<b>Note</b> that:

- The valid operators are `'+'`, `'-'`, `'*'`, and `'/'`.
- Each operand may be an integer or another expression.
- The division between two integers always <b>truncates toward zero.</b>
- There will not be any division by zero.
- The input represents a valid arithmetic expression in a reverse polish notation.
- The answer and all the intermediate calculations can be represented in a <b>32-bit</b> integer.
 

## Example 1
Input: `tokens = ["2","1","+","3","*"]`
Output: `9`
Explanation: `((2 + 1) * 3) = 9`

## Example 2
Input: `tokens = ["4","13","5","/","+"]`
Output: `6`
Explanation: `(4 + (13 / 5)) = 6`

## Example 3
Input: `tokens = ["10","6","9","3","+","-11","*","/","*","17","+","5","+"]`
Output: `22`
Explanation: `((10 * (6 / ((9 + 3) * -11))) + 17) + 5
= ((10 * (6 / (12 * -11))) + 17) + 5
= ((10 * (6 / -132)) + 17) + 5
= ((10 * 0) + 17) + 5
= (0 + 17) + 5
= 17 + 5
= 22`

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def evalRPN(self, tokens: List[str]) -> int:
        stack = []
    
        for token in tokens:
            if token in "+-*/":
                # Pop two elements from the stack
                b = stack.pop()
                a = stack.pop() 
            
                # Perform the operation and push the result back onto the stack
                if token == '+':
                    stack.append(a + b)
                elif token == '-':
                    stack.append(a - b)
                elif token == '*':
                    stack.append(a * b)
                elif token == '/':
                    # Integer division truncates towards zero
                    stack.append(int(a / b))
            else:
                # If the token is a number, push it onto the stack
                stack.append(int(token))
    
        # The last element in the stack is the result of the computation
        return stack.pop()
```

## Complexity Analysis
- Time Complexity: O(n), The method processes each token in the input list once, handling operations in constant time.
- Space Complexity: O(n), Space usage can peak at n if all tokens are numbers, as the stack may store all elements before any operations reduce its size.
