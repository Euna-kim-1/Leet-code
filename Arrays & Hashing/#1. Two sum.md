# Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.

You may assume that each input would have <b>exactly one solution</b>, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

## Example 1
Input: `nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9`  
Output: `[0,1]`
Explanation: `Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].`

## Example 2
Input: `nums = [3,2,4], target = 6`  
Output: `[1,2]`

## Example 3
Input: `nums = [3,3], target = 6`  
Output: `[0,1]`

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        # Initialize an empty dictionary called 'preMap'. 
        # This dictionary will be used to stroe the previously visited numbers along with their indices.
        preMap = {}

        # Iterate over the elemetns of the 'nums' list along with their indices.
        # 'i' represents the index, and 'n' represents the value of the current element.
        for i, n in enumerate(nums):
        # This line calculate the difference between the target value and the current element 'n'.
        # This difference represents the value that, when added to 'n', will equal the 'target'.   
            diff = target - n

        # Check if the calcualted difference 'diff' exists as a key in the 'preMap' dictionary.
        # If it does, it means that we have found two numbers whose sum equals the target.    
            if diff in preMap:
                
        # If the difference exists in the 'preMap', it means that we have previsouly encountered
        # the number needed to complement the current number to reach the target sum.
                return [preMap[diff], i]

        # Stores the current number 'n' along with its index 'i' in the 'preMap' dictionary. 
        # This allows us to look up the index of a number in constant time during the iteration.    
            preMap[n] = i

        return 
```

## Complexity Analysis
- Time Complexity: O(n),iterates through the list once, performing constant-time operations.
- Space Complexity: O(n),utilizes a dictionary (preMap) to store previously visited numbers and indices, growing linearly with input size. No other data structures used, resulting in linear space complexity.
