# Problem Statement

Given an unsorted array of integers `nums`, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(n)` time.

## Example 1
Input: `nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]`
Output: `4`
Explanation: `The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.`

## Example 2
Input: `nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]`
Output: `9`

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def longestConsecutive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        # Create a set named 'hashSet' containing the unique elements of the input list 'nums'.
        hashSet = set(nums)
        longest = 0

        # Iterate through each element 'num' in the 'hashSet'
        for num in hashSet :
            # Checks if the previous number '(num - 1)' is not present in the 'hashSet'.
            if (num -1) not in hashSet:
                # Initilize two varibles:
                currentNum = num
                currentStreak = 1

                # Enters a loop that continues as long as the next number '(currentNum + 1)' is present in the 'hashSet'
                while (currentNum + 1) in hashSet:
                    currentNum += 1
                    currentStreak += 1

                # Updates the 'longest' variable with the maximum value between the current 'longest' and 'currentStreak.'
                longest = max(longest, currentStreak)

        return longest
```

## Complexity Analysis
- Time Complexity: O(n), due to iterating through the list once.
- Space Complexity: O(n),  because of storing elements in a hash set.
