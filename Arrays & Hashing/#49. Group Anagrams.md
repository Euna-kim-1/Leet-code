# Problem Statement

Given an array of strings `strs`, group <b>the anagrams</b> together. You can return the answer in <b>any order</b>.

An <b>Anagram</b> is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

## Example 1
Input: `strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]`
Output: `[["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]`

## Example 2
Input: `strs = [""]`
Output: `[[""]]`

## Example 3
Input: `strs = ["a"]`
Output: `[["a"]]`

## Solution1

```python
from collections import defaultdict

class Solution:
    def groupAnagrams(self, strs: List[str]) -> List[List[str]]:
       # Initialized with an empty list as default value. 
       # This dictionary will be used to store the groups of anagrams.
        dic = defaultdict(list)

        # Iterates over each word in the input list 'strs'
        for word in strs:
            # Sorts the characters of the current 'word', join them back into a string, 
            # and uses that sorted string as a key in the 'dic', dictionary.
            # The corresponding value is a list where the original 'word' is appended.
            dic["".join(sorted(word))].append(word)
        return dic.values()
```

## Complexity Analysis
- Time Complexity: O(n), because sorting operation is performed on each word.
- Space Complexity: O(n),  the size of the dictionary scales with the number of words in the list, as it is needed to group all words.
