# Problem Statement

Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` if `t` is an anagram of `s`, and `false` otherwise.

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

## Example 1
Input: `s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"`  
Output: `true`

## Example 2
Input: `s = "rat", t = "car"` 
Output: `false`

## Solution1

```python
class Solution:
    def isAnagram(s: str, t: str) -> bool:
      # This line checks if the lengths of two input strings 's' and 't' are not equal,
      # it means two strings cannot be anagrams, so the method returns 'Fa'se/
      if len(s) != len(t):
        return False

      # Initialize two dictionaries to store the character counts for each string. 
      char_count_s = {}
      char_count_t = {}

      # Iterate through each character in both strings and update their respective counts in the dictionaries.
      for char in s:
        char_count_s[char] = char_count_s.get(char, 0) + 1
    
      for char in t:
        char_count_t[char] = char_count_t.get(char, 0) + 1

      # Compare the counts of characters in both dictionaries. If they match for all characters, return 'true', otherwise return 'false'.
      return char_count_s == char_count_t
```

## Complexity Analysis
- Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the strings s and t.
- Space Complexity: O(n), to store the counts of characters in the dictionaries.

```python
class Solution:
    def isAnagram(s: str, t: str) -> bool:
      # This line checks if the lengths of two input strings 's' and 't' are not equal,
      # it means two strings cannot be anagrams, so the method returns 'Fa'se/
      if len(s) != len(t):
        return False

      # Initialize two dictionaries to store the character counts for each string. 
      countS = {}
      countT = {}

      # Iterates over the characters of both strings 's' and 't'.
      # For each character at index 'i', it increments the count of that character dictionary('countS' for 's' and 'countT' for 't'.)
      for i in range(len(s)):
      # It uses the 'get' method to retrieve the currnet count of the character from the dictionary.
      # If the character is not already represent in the dictionary, it default to 0.
         countS[s[i]] = 1+ countS.get(s[i],0)
         countT[t[i]] = 1+ countT.get(t[i],0)

      # Iterates over the keys(characters) in the 'countS' dictionary. For each character, it checks if the count of that character in 'countS' is equal to the count of the same character 'countT'.
      # If they are not equal, it means the character occur different numbers of times in two strings, so the method returns 'False'.
      for c in countS:
        if countS[c] != countT.get(c,0):
          return False
      return True
```

## Complexity Analysis
- Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the longer string between s and t.
- Space Complexity: O(n), to store the counts of characters in the dictionaries.
