# Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums`, return an array `answer` such that `answer[i]` is equal to the product of all the elements of `nums` except `nums[i]`.

The product of any prefix or suffix of `nums` is <b>guaranteed</b> to fit in a <b>32-bit</b> integer.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(n)` time and without using the division operation.

## Example 1
Input: `nums = [1,2,3,4]`
Output: `[24,12,8,6]`

## Example 2
Input: `nums = [-1,1,0,-3,3]`
Output: `[0,0,9,0,0]`

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def productExceptSelf(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        # Create a list 'res' initialized with 1s, having the same length as the input list 'nums'
        res = [1] * (len(nums))

        prefix = 1
        # Iterate through each index 'i' in the range of the length of 'nums'
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            # Store the current value of 'prefix' in the 'res' list at index 'i'
            res[i] = prefix
            # Update 'prefix' by multiplying it with the value at index 'i' in 'nums'
            prefix *= nums[i]
            print(res)

        postfix = 1
        # Iterate through each index 'i' in reverse order from the last index to the first index of 'nums'
        for i in range(len(nums) - 1, -1, -1):
            # Update the value at index 'i' in 'res' by multiplying it with the current value of 'postfix'
            res[i] *= postfix
            print(res)
            # Update 'postfix' by multiplying it with the value at index 'i' in 'nums'
            postfix *= nums[i]
        print(res)
        return res
```

## Complexity Analysis
- Time Complexity: O(n), Linear time due to traversing the input list twice, forward and backward.
- Space Complexity: O(n),Linear space usage as it requires an additional array (res) to store the left and right products for each element in the input list.
