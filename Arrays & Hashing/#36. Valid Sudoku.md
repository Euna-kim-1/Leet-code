# Problem Statement

Determine if a `9 x 9` Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated <b>according to the following rules:</b>

1. Each row must contain the digits `1-9` without repetition.
2. Each column must contain the digits `1-9` without repetition.
3. Each of the nine `3 x 3` sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits `1-9` without repetition.

<b>Note:</b>

- A Sudoku board (partially filled) could be valid but is not necessarily solvable.
- Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the mentioned rules.

## Example 1

Input: board = 
[["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]
,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]
,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]
,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]
,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]
,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]
,[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."]
,[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"]
,[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]
Output: true

## Example 2
Input: board = 
[["8","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]
,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]
,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]
,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]
,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]
,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]
,[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."]
,[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"]
,[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]
Output: false
Explanation: Same as Example 1, except with the 5 in the top left corner being modified to 8. Since there are two 8's in the top left 3x3 sub-box, it is invalid.

<b>Constraints:</b>

- `board.length == 9`
- `board[i].length == 9`
- `board[i][j] is a digit 1-9 or '.'.`

## Solution

```python
import collections 
class Solution:
    def isValidSudoku(self, board: List[List[str]]) -> bool:
        # Create a dictionary to store the state of columns.
        cols = collections.defaultdict(set)
        # Create a dictionary to store the state of rows.
        rows = collections.defaultdict(set)
        # Create a dictionary to store the state of 3x3 squared on the sudoku board.
        squares = collections.defaultdict(set)

        # Iterate over each cell of the sudoku board.
        for r in range(9):
            for c in range(9):
                # If the current cell is empty, the code skips to the next iteration.
                if board[r][c] == ".":
                    continue
                # If the current cell's number is already present in the same row, column, or 3x3 square.
                # If it is, it means the sudoku board is invalid.
                if (board[r][c] in rows [r] or
                    board[r][c] in cols [c] or
                    board[r][c] in squares[(r // 3, c // 3)]):
                    return False
                # Add the number of the current cell to the respective column, row, and 3x3 square.
                cols[c].add(board[r][c])
                rows[r].add(board[r][c])
                squares[(r // 3, c // 3)].add(board[r][c])
        return True
```

## Complexity Analysis
- Time Complexity: O(n^2), Since we need to check every cell in the given sudoku board, we use a nested loop to visit each cell once.
- Space Complexity: O(n), The space used in the code consists of three dictionaries (cols, rows, squares). Each dictionary consumes O(N) space. Thus the overall space complexity is O(3N).
