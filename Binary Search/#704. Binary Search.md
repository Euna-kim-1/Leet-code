# Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `nums` which is sorted in ascending order, and an integer `target`, write a function to search `target` in `nums`. If `target` exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return `-1`.

You must write an algorithm with `O(log n)` runtime complexity.

## Example 1
Input: `nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 9`
Output: `4`
Explanation: `9 exists in nums and its index is 4`

## Example 2:

Input: `nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 2`
Output: `-1`
Explanation: `2 does not exist in nums so return -1`

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def search(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        # Initialize the left and right pointer
        l = 0
        r = len(nums) - 1

        # Continue the search while the search range is valid
        while l <= r:
            # Calculate the middle index of the current search range
            m = (l + r) // 2
            # If the middle value is greater than the target
            if nums[m] > target:
                # Update the right boundary to the left of the middle
                r = m - 1
            # If the middle value is is less than the target
            elif nums[m] < target:
                # Update the left boundary to the right of the middle
                l = m + 1
            # If the middle value is equal to the target
            else:
                # Return the middle index
                return m

        # If the target is not found, return -1        
        return -1

```
