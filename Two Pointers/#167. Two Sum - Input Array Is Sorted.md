# Problem Statement

Given a <b>1-indexed</b> array of integers `numbers` that is already <b>sorted in non-decreasing order</b>, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number. 

Let these two numbers be `numbers[index1]` and `numbers[index2]` where `1 <= index1 < index2 <= numbers.length`.

Return the indices of the two numbers, `index1` and `index2`, <b>added by one</b> as an integer array `[index1, index2]` of length 2.

The tests are generated such that there is <b>exactly one solution</b>. You <b>may not</b> use the same element twice.

Your solution must use only constant extra space.

## Example 1
Input: `numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9`
Output: `[1,2]`
Explanation: `The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore, index1 = 1, index2 = 2. We return [1, 2].`

## Example 2
Input: `numbers = [2,3,4], target = 6`
Output: `[1,3]`
Explanation: `The sum of 2 and 4 is 6. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 3. We return [1, 3].`

## Example 3
Input: `numbers = [-1,0], target = -1`
Output: `[1,2]`
Explanation: `The sum of -1 and 0 is -1. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2. We return [1, 2].`

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, numbers: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        # Initialize two pointers
        left = 0
        right = len(numbers) - 1

        # Iterate through the list until the left pointer is less than the right pointer.
        while left < right:
            # Calculate the sum of the elements at the current pointers.
            sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right]
            # If the sum equals the target, return the indices of the two elements.
            if sum == target:
                return [left + 1, right + 1]
            # If the sum is greater than the target, move the right pointer to the left.
            elif sum > target:
                right -= 1
            # If the sum is less than the target, move the left pointer to the right.
            else:
                left += 1
        return [-1, -1]
```

## Complexity Analysis
- Time Complexity: O(n), Linear time complexity due to single-pass iteration through the list.
- Space Complexity: O(1), Constant space complexity as the extra space used is independent of the input size.
