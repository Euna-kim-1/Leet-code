# Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `height` of length `n`. There are `n` vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the `ith` line are `(i, 0)` and `(i, height[i])`.

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

<b>Notice</b> that you may not slant the container.

## Example 1
Input: `height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]`
Output: `49`
Explanation: `The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.`


## Example 2
Input: `height = [1,1]`
Output: `1`

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        # Initialize a variable to store the maximum area encoutered so far.
        max_area = 0
        # Initilize two pointers, representing the leftmost and rightmost lines of the container
        left = 0
        right = len(height) - 1

        # Start a loop that continues as long as the 'left' pointer is less than the 'right' pointer.
        while left < right:
            # Calculate the area with the current two lines
            current_area = min(height[left], height[right]) * (right - left)
            # Update max_area if the current area is greater
            max_area = max(max_area, current_area)

            # Move the pointer of the shorter line towards the center 
            if height[left] < height[right]:
                left += 1
            else:
                right -= 1
        return max_area
```

## Complexity Analysis
- Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input array height. This is because the solution involves a single pass through the array, and at each step, we only perform constant time operations.
- Space Complexity: O(1), meaning it uses constant extra space regardless of the size of the input array. This is because the algorithm only requires a fixed amount of space for storing variables like max_area, left, and right, and does not depend on the size of the input array. Therefore, the space complexity is constant.
