# Problem Statement

A phrase is a <b>palindrome</b> if, after converting all uppercase letters into lowercase letters and removing all non-alphanumeric characters, it reads the same forward and backward. Alphanumeric characters include letters and numbers.

Given a string `s`, return `true` if it is a <b>palindrome</b>, or `false` otherwise.

## Example 1

Input: s = `"A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"`
Output: `true`
Explanation: `"amanaplanacanalpanama" is a palindrome.`

## Example 2
Input: `s = "race a car"`
Output: `false`
Explanation: `"raceacar" is not a palindrome.`

## Example 2
Input: `s = " "`
Output: `true`
Explanation: `s is an empty string "" after removing non-alphanumeric characters.
Since an empty string reads the same forward and backward, it is a palindrome.`

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, s: str) -> bool:
        # Remove non-alphanumeric characters and convert to lowercase
        string = ''.join(char.lower() for char in s if 'a' <= char.lower() <='z' 
        or '0' <= char <= '9')

        print(string)
        # Check if the string is equal to its reverse
        return string == string[::-1]
```

## Complexity Analysis
- Time Complexity: O(n), The algorithm traverses the string once to extract only alphabets and digits, and then it compares the original string with its reverse.
- Space Complexity: O(n), The additional memory used is for the cleaned string. Since the length of the cleaned string is at most equal to the length of the input string.
