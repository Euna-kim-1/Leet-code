# Problem Statement

Given an integer array nums, return all the triplets `[nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]]` such that `i != j`, `i != k`, and `j != k`, and `nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0`.

Notice that the solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

## Example 1
Input: `nums = [-1,0,1,2,-1,-4]`
Output: `[[-1,-1,2],[-1,0,1]]`
Explanation: 
`nums[0] + nums[1] + nums[2] = (-1) + 0 + 1 = 0.
nums[1] + nums[2] + nums[4] = 0 + 1 + (-1) = 0.
nums[0] + nums[3] + nums[4] = (-1) + 2 + (-1) = 0.
The distinct triplets are [-1,0,1] and [-1,-1,2].
Notice that the order of the output and the order of the triplets does not matter.`

## Example 2
Input: `nums = [0,1,1]`
Output: `[]`
Explanation: `The only possible triplet does not sum up to 0.`

## Example 3
Input: `nums = [0,0,0]`
Output: `[[0,0,0]]`
Explanation: `The only possible triplet sums up to 0.`

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def threeSum(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        # nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0
        # Create empty array for output
        res = []
        # It is necessary to sort the list of numbers.
        nums.sort()

        # We need to skip repeated numbers first. 
        for i in range(len(nums) -2):
            # If the current number is the same as the previous one, skip.
            if i > 0 and nums[i] == nums[i-1]:
                continue

            left = i +1
            right = len(nums) -1
            # We will use two loops, and in the first loop, select the first number. 
            while left < right:
                total = nums[i] + nums[left] + nums[right]

                # In the second loop, we use two pointers to move within the range.
                # We find combinations such that the sum is 0 using two pointers.
                # If the sum is greater than 0, decrease the third number; if less than 0, increase the second number.
                # If the sum of three numbers is 0, add it to the result list.
                if total < 0 :
                    left += 1
                elif total > 0:
                    right -= 1
                else:
                    res.append([nums[i], nums[left], nums[right]])
                    
                    # Skip duplicates for the second and third numbers.
                    while left < right and nums[left] == nums[left + 1]: 
                      left += 1  
                    while left < right and nums[right] == nums[right - 1]: 
                      right -= 1  
         
                    left += 1
                    right -= 1
        return res
```

## Complexity Analysis
- Time Complexity: O(n^2), because of the nested loops iterating through the elements of the input list.
- Space Complexity: O(n), due to the output list and the sorting step.
